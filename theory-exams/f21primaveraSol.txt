Use the text symbols:     &    v   -   |=       for     AND  OR  NOT  and  "SATISFIES",   like:
      I  |=  p & (q v -r)     (the interpretation I satisfies the formula p & (q v -r)  ).

Problem 1. (3 points).                                   @n@nota1:
For each one of the following statements, indicate if it is true or false for propositional logic.
Answer T (true) or F (false) on each dotted line ... Give no explanations why.
Below always F,G,H are formulas and I is an interpretation.

Answer:
  F      If H is not a logical consequence of F & G   then  F & G & H is unsatisfiable. 
  T      If F is a tautology, then for every G we have G |=  F.
  T      If F is unsatisfiable then -F is a tautology.
  T      If  F & G  |=  -H then F & G & H is unsatisfiable.
  T      There are infinitely many different formulas, even if there is only one predicate symbol.
  T      F |= G  iff  F & -G is unsatisfiable.
  T      Given I and F, it is decidable in linear time whether I |= F.
  T      Given F, it is decidable whether F is satisfiable.
  T      If  F v G  |=  H  then F & -H is unsatisfiable. 
  T      The formula  p v p  is a logical consequence of  (p v q v r)  &  (-q v r)  &  (-r). 
  F      If F is unsatisfiable, then for every G we have G |= F.
  T      There are formulas F and G such that  F |= G  and  F |= -G.
  T      The formula  (p v q) &  (-p v q) &  (-p v -q) & (-q v p)  is unsatisfiable.
  F      If F is a tautology, then for every G we have F |= G. 
  F      If F is unsatisfiable then -F  |=  F.
  T      F is satisfiable if, and only if, all logical consequences of F are satisfiable formulas.

Problem 2. (1 point).                                   @n@nota2:
What is the cost of deciding the satisfiability of a given set of clauses S?
Answer without explaining why, for the following cases:

2a) All clauses in S are Horn clauses.

Answer: linear

2b) All clauses in S are one-literal or two-literal clauses.

Answer: linear

2c) All clauses in S are one-literal,  two-literal, or three-literal clauses.

Answer: NP-complete



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 3. (3 points).                                   @n@nota3:
Same question as problem 2. In this case, explain very briefly why.
For b) and c): try to give a precise cost. Hint for b): how many ways are there to satisfy the clause C?

3a) For each clause C in S we have:  C is a Horn clause or C is a two-literal clause.

Answer: NP-complete. When you combine them, it does not help that Horn-SAT and 2-SAT are linear individually.
        To show NP-hardness, we can easily reduce any SAT problem for a clause set S to it:
	Let x1...xn be the variables in S. Introduce new variables y1...yn.
	Let S1 be the set of clauses all 2n clauses xi v yi,   -xi v -yi, indicating that yi is the negation of xi.
        Replace all positive literals xi in S by -yi, obtaining the clause set S2.
	Then S is satisfiable iff the set S1 U S2 is satisfiable (but all clauses in S1 are Horn and
	all clauses of S2 are 2-literal clauses).

3b) All clauses in S are Horn clauses, except for one clause C in S.

Answer: cuadratic: for each literal lit in C, try a linear Horn-Sat for  S U {lit}.

3c) All clauses in S are Horn clauses, except for two clauses C1 and C2.

Answer: cubic: for each lit1 in C1 and each lit2 in C2, try a linear Horn-Sat for S U {lit1,lit2}.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 4. (3 points).                                   @n@nota4:
MaxSAT is the problem that takes as input a natural number k and a set of propositional clauses S, and
it asks whether there is any interpretation I satisfying at least k clauses of S.

4a) Do you think that MaxSAT is polynomial? NP-complete? Exponential? Explain very briefly why.

Answer: NP-complete:
-it is in NP because we can check solutions in PTIME (in fact, linear time).
-it is NP-hard, because we can reduce SAT of a set of clauses S to MaxSAT of S setting k=|S|.

4b) How would you use a SAT solver to decide MaxSAT?

Answer: Let S  be {C1...Cn}. Introduce new variables a1...an.
        Let S1 be {C1 v -a1 ... Cn v -an}.
	Let S2 be the set of clauses encoding the cardinality constraint a1+...+an >= k.
	Run the SAT solver on S1 U S2.
	
4c) How would you use a SAT solver to solve the optimization version of MaxSAT, that is,
how to find the $I$ that satisfies as many of the clauses of $S$ as possible?

Answer: As in 4b, but:
        step 1: starting with k=1.
	step 2: If satisfiable with I where I(a1)+...+I(an) = q, re-run step 2 with k = q+1.
        Repeat until unsat. The optimal will be the q of the last solution.

FIRST-ORDER LOGIC.


Problem 5. (3 points).                                   @n@nota5:
For each one of the following statements, indicate if it is true(T) or false(F) for first-order logic.
Give no explanations why. Below always F,G,H are formulas and I is an interpretation.

Answer:
  T      There are infinitely many different formulas, even if there is only one predicate symbol.
  F      Given I and F, it is decidable in linear time whether I |=  F.
  F      Given I and F, it is decidable whether I |=  F.
  F      Given F, it is decidable in polynomial time whether F is satisfiable.
  F      Given F, it is decidable whether F is satisfiable.
  T      F |= G iff F & -G is unsatisfiable.
  T      F is a tautology  iff  -F is unsatisfiable.
  F      Given F and G, it is co-semi-decidable whether  F |= G.
  T      Given F and G, it is semi-decidable whether F and G are logically equivalent,
  F      We can express with a formula F that all models of F have a domain of size at most 3.
  T      Given a formula F and an interpretation I with domain D_I of size 4, it is decidable whether I |=  F.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 6. (3 points).                                   @n@nota6:
6a) Is the formula  Ax ( -p(x,f(x))  &  -p(f(x),x)  &  ( Ey p(f(x),y)  v  Ez p(z,f(x)) )   )  satisfiable?  Prove it.


Answer: yes. For example the following interpretation I is a model:
        D_I = {a,b}
        f_I(a) = a
        f_I(b) = b    
        p_I(a,a) = 0
        p_I(a,b) = 1
        p_I(b,a) = 1
        p_I(b,b) = 0        Another model: the natural numbrs with f the identity function and p >.
    
6b) 
Let I1 and I2 be first-order interpretations with domains D_I1 = Q (the rationals) and D_I2 = R (the reals).
In both interpretations, the unary function symbol "square" is interpreted as square_I(x) = x*x. 
Write a formula F in FOLE (first-order logic with equality), using no other predicate or function symbols
apart from square, such that F is true in one of the interpretations and false in the other one.

Answer:
First note that it is NOT correct to say that every number has a square root, like Ax Ey square(y)=x  because this
is false in BOTH interpretations because of the negative numbers.  Nice try, though.

But we can say that every square number x has a fourth root z (false in Q, true in R):
      Ax (   (Ey square(y)=x)  -->  (Ez square(square(z))=x) )
or, shorter:
      Ax Ey  square(square(y))=square(x)

We can also say that if two different numbers x and y have the same square (that is, x = -y) then at
least one of them has a square root (also false in Q, true in R):
F : AxAy ( (square(x)=square(y) & -(x=y) ) --> Ez ( square(z)=x v square(z)=y ) )


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 7. (4 points).                                   @n@nota7:
Formalize and prove by resolution that sentence F is a logical consequence of the first five:

A: John eats all kind of food.
B: If a person eats something that kills, then that person is dead
C: Everything that does not kill and is eaten by someone is food
D: Mary is not dead
E: Mary eats peanuts
F: John eats peanuts.

We obtain by resolution the empty clause from A & B & C & D & E & -F:

A:   Ax ( isfood(x) --> eats(john,x) )
B:   Ax ( (Ey eats(x,y) & kills(y)) --> isdead(x) )
C:   Ax ( (Ey eats(y,x) & -kills(x)) --> isfood(x) )
D:   -isdead(mary)
E:   eats(mary,peanuts)
F:   eats(john,peanuts)

Clauses:
 A: -isfood(x) v eats(john,x)
 B: -eats(x,y) v -kills(y) v isdead(x)
 C: -eats(y,x) v  kills(x) v isfood(x)
 D: -isdead(mary)
 E: eats(mary,peanuts)
-F: -eats(john,peanuts)

Resolution:
N   From:     mgu:              new clause:
1.  B,D       { x=mary    }     -eats(mary,y) v -kills(y)
2.  1,E       { y=peanuts }     -kills(peanuts)
3.  C,2       { x=peanuts }     -eats(y,peanuts) v isfood(peanuts)
4.  3,E       { y=mary    }     isfood(peanuts)
5.  4,1       { x=peanuts }     eats(john,peanuts)
6.  5,-F      {}                []
